Info 3220 Assignment 3 Doccumentation

In this assignment i worked with a ui interface to perform a number of actions on the bodies of type universe
I have 11 buttons in UI.
Pause:In pause i stop the timer and set pause as enabled to one,when pause is enabled all the bodies on the view will be still.
Reclicking pause will enable the program and let it run again

Zodiacs:When the zodiac button si clicked my program checks with all the corresponding celestial bodies of the config file to see if there are any zodiac lines between two suns.
Labels:Whenever label is clicked the program jus disables the name of the planet and continues the simulation.
ZoomOut:Whenever zoom Out button is clicked i assign the distance scale to m_distanceScale*=1.1;
ZoomIn :Whenever Zoom In is clicked i assign the distance scale to m_distanceScale*=0.9;

i have also mouse enabled zooming using the mouse pad for my simulation

TimeStep Increase : whenever Time stamp Increase button is clicked i assign the m_physicsStepSize to +=100000  
TimeStep Decrease : whenever Time stamp Decrease button is clicked i assign the m_physicsStepSize to -=100000  
ViewAll :Whenever the view all button is clicked i zoom out so the usercan view all the planets in the universe.Reclicking ViewAll returns to the original state
Rotate Left or right:Whenever the Rotate Left or right button is clicked i change the angle of all the planets so they are mapped on different x,y coordinates based on the values.

Save State and restore state are being used for the design Pattern Momento
In save state i am saving the x,y,xForce,yForce,xVel,yVel to a list .
And in the restore i am asking the user which state they would like to go back to.
I am also using the visitor design patter to get planet information on to a TextBrowser which is visible on the screen and modifiying the planet for instance,if any object is clicked and the x,y coordinates are almost similar
i use my visitor to get the information about that UniverseBody.

I also use mosue click events for centering the entier view for any given Universebody.
